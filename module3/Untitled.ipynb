    "Unstructured data makes up the vast majority of data.  This is a basic intro to\n",

    "\n",
    "Your model will be assessed based on how root mean squared error of the number\n",
    "of stars you predict.  There is a reference solution (which should not be too\n",
    "hard to beat) that defines the score of 1.\n",

    "## Helpful notes:\n",
    "- You may run into trouble with the size of your models and Digital Ocean's\n",
    "  memory limit. This is a major concern in real-world applications. Your\n",
    "  production environment will likely not be that different from Digital Ocean\n",
    "  and being able to deploy there is important and companies don't want to hire\n",
    "  data scientists who cannot cope with this. Think about what information the\n",
    "  different stages of your pipeline need and how you can reduce the memory\n",
    "  footprint.\n",
    "- For example, submitting entire GridSearchCV objects will not work reliably\n",
    "  depending on the size of your models. If you use GridSearchCV, consult the\n",
    "  documentation to find the attributes that allow you to extract the best\n",
    "  estimator and/or parameters. (Remember to retrain on the entire dataset\n",
    "  before submitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submission\n",
    "Replace the return values in `__init__.py` with predictions from your models.\n",
    "Avoid running \"on-the-fly\" computations or scripts in this file. Ideally you\n",
    "should load your pickled model from file (in the global scope) then call\n",
    "`model.predict(record)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all functions take an argument `record`. Samples of `record` are\n",
    "given in `test_json.py`. Your model will be passed a single record during\n",
    "grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## bag_of_words_model\n",
    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the count of the words\n",
    "in each document (bag-of-words model).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance\n",
    "   but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial\n",
    "   step:\n",
    "   ```Python\n",
    "       X = feature_extraction.text \\\n",
    "                             .CountVectorizer() \\\n",
    "                             .fit_transform(text)\n",
    "       y = scores\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   and then running grid-serach and cross-validation only on of this\n",
    "   pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between\n",
    "   words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of\n",
    "   the vocabulary.  The `HashingVectorizer` does not have to remember this\n",
    "   mapping and will lead to much smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency\n",
    "   cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits\n",
    "   rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both\n",
    "   prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget\n",
    "   to use cross-validation or to select the right value.  Notice that\n",
    "   `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`.  However, it's\n",
    "   not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try using `LinearRegression` or `RidgeCV`.  If the memory footprint is too\n",
    "   big, try switching to Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "   (`sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor`) You might find that even ordinary\n",
    "   linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use\n",
    "   `GridSearchCV` to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the\n",
    "   regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df`\n",
    "   from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "## normalized_model\n",
    "Normalization is key for good linear regression. Previously, we used the count\n",
    "as the normalization scheme.  Try some of these alternative vectorizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use the \"does this word present in this document\" as a normalization\n",
    "   scheme, which means the values are always 1 or 0.  So we give no additional\n",
    "   weight to the presence of the word multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try using the log of the number of counts (or more precisely, $log(x+1)$).\n",
    "   This is often used because we want the repeated presence of a word to count\n",
    "   for more but not have that effect tapper off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a common\n",
    "   normalization scheme used in text processing.  Use the `TFIDFTransformer`.\n",
    "   There are options for using `idf` and taking the logarithm of `tf`.  Do\n",
    "   these significantly affect the result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you can't decide which one is better, don't forget that you can\n",
    "combine models with a linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## bigram_model\n",
    "In a bigram model, let's consider both single words and pairs of consecutive\n",
    "words that appear.  This is going to be a much higher dimensional problem\n",
    "(large $p$) so you should be careful about overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, reducing the dimension can be useful.  Because we are dealing with a\n",
    "sparse matrix, we have to use `TruncatedSVD`.  If we reduce the dimensions, we\n",
    "can use a more sophisticated models than linear ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, memory problems can crop up due to the engineering constraints.\n",
    "Playing with the number of features, using the `HashingVectorizer`,\n",
    "incorporating `min_df` and `max_df` limits, and handling stop-words in some way\n",
    "are all methods of addressing this issue. If you are using `CountVectorizer`,\n",
    "it is possible to run it with a fixed vocabulary (based on a training run, for\n",
    "instance). Check the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A side note on multi-stage model evaluation:** When your model consists of a\n",
    "pipeline with several stages, it can be worthwhile to evaluate which parts of\n",
    "the pipeline have the greatest impact on the overall accuracy (or other metric)\n",
    "of the model. This allows you to focus your efforts on improving the important\n",
    "algorithms, and leaving the rest \"good enough\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to accomplish this is through ceiling analysis, which can be useful\n",
    "when you have a training set with ground truth values at each stage. Let's say\n",
    "you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a\n",
    "list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point\n",
    "reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the\n",
    "correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves\n",
    "(maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for\n",
    "each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is\n",
    "a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a\n",
    "relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know the right answers at different stages of the pipeline, you\n",
    "can still evaluate how important different parts of the model are to its\n",
    "performance by changing or removing certain steps while keeping everything\n",
    "else constant. You might try this kind of analysis to determine how important\n",
    "adding stopwords and stemming to your NLP model actually is, and how that\n",
    "importance changes with parameters like the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## food_bigrams\n",
    "Look over all reviews of restaurants (you may need to look at the dataset from\n",
    "the first machine learning miniproject to figure out which ones correspond to\n",
    "restaurants). We want to find collocations --- that is, bigrams that are\n",
    "\"special\" and appear more often than you'd expect from chance.  We can think of\n",
    "the corpus as defining an empirical distribution over all ngrams.  We can find\n",
    "word pairs that are unlikely to occur consecutively based on the underlying\n",
    "probability of their words. Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a\n",
    "word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we\n",
    "want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ p(w_1 w_2) / (p(w_1) * p(w_2)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is high.  Return the top 100 (mostly food) bigrams with this statistic with\n",
    "the 'right' prior factor (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Questions:* This statistic is a ratio and problematic when the denominator\n",
    "is small.  We can fix this by applying Bayesian smoothing to $p(w)$\n",
    "(i.e. mixing the empirical distribution with the uniform distribution over\n",
    "the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does changing this smoothing parameter affect the word pairs you get\n",
    "   qualitatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can interpret the smoothing parameter as adding a constant number of\n",
    "   occurrences of each word to our distribution.  Does this help you determine\n",
    "   set a reasonable value for this 'prior factor'?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For fun: also check out [Amazon's Statistically Improbable\n",
    "   Phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_Improbable_Phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation note:*\n",
    "As you adjust the size of the Bayesian smoothing parameter, you will notice\n",
    "first nonsense phrases being removed and then legitimate bigrams being removed,\n",
    "leaving you with only generic bigrams.  The goal is to find a value of the\n",
    "smoothing parameter between these two transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference solution is not an aggressive filterer: it errors in favor of\n",
    "leaving apparently nonsensical words. On further consideration, many of these\n",
    "are actually somewhat meaningful. The smoothing parameter chosen in the\n",
    "reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 90 previous appearances\n",
    "prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams\n",
    "for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were\n",
    "shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we\n",
    "judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too\n",
    "high, where it could exclude these borderline words.\n"
